# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart's sales data to identify top-performing branches and products, sales trends, and customer behavior. The goal is to derive insights that can help optimize sales strategies.

The dataset was sourced from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting), which provides historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores. The dataset includes various factors such as store locations, department-wise sales, and holiday markdown events that influence sales performance.

## üéØ Objectives
- Understand the factors influencing sales across different branches.
- Identify the most and least performing product lines.
- Analyze customer demographics and buying patterns.
- Evaluate the impact of sales strategies and seasonal trends.

## üìä Dataset Overview
The dataset contains sales transactions from three Walmart branches located in **Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw**. It consists of **17 columns and 1000 rows**, providing detailed insights into transactions.

## üìå Revenue & Profit Calculation

The financial calculations used in this project are:

\[ \text{COGS} = \text{Unit Price} \times \text{Quantity} \]

\[ \text{VAT} = 5\% \times \text{COGS} \]

\[ \text{Total Sales (Gross Revenue)} = \text{COGS} + \text{VAT} \]

\[ \text{Gross Profit} = \text{Total Sales} - \text{COGS} \]

\[ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Income}}{\text{Total Revenue}} \]

### Example Calculation:
- **Unit Price** = 45.79
- **Quantity** = 7
- **COGS** = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53
- **VAT** = 5% of 320.53 = 16.03
- **Total Revenue** = 320.53 + 16.03 = 336.56
- **Gross Margin** = (16.03 / 336.56) ‚âà **4.76%**

## üíª SQL Implementation

The data is processed and analyzed using SQL. The database is structured as follows:

```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS walmart_sales;

-- Create sales table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales (
    invoice_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    branch VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    customer_type VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    product_line VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    tax_pct FLOAT(6,4) NOT NULL,
    total DECIMAL(12,4) NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    time TIME NOT NULL,
    payment VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    cogs DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    gross_margin_pct FLOAT(11,9),
    gross_income DECIMAL(12,4),
    rating FLOAT(2,1)
);
